  <h1><b>Internet Protocols and IP Address</b></h1>
  <p><b>Internet Protocols (IP)</b> are set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted and received across networks, ensuring efficient communication between devices. 
    Their main <b>function</b> is to define rules and formats for how data is packaged, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received across networks like the Internet.
    Some common examples of Internet protocols include:
    <b>TCP/IP</b> (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol),  
    <b>HTTP</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol), 
    <b>HTTPS</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure ), 
    <b>FTP</b> (File Transfer Protocol), 
    and <b>SMTP</b> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
  </p>

  <h2><b>Types and Versions of IP Addresses</b></h2>

  <p>
    <b>IP addresses</b> is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication, and help to identify and locate devices on a network, enabling them to communicate and exchange data. . 
    There are two main versions of IP addresses: <b>IPv4</b> and <b>IPv6</b>.
    <b>IPv4</b> uses a 32-bit address format and is the most commonly used version, while <b>IPv6</b> uses a 128-bit format and is designed to handle the growing number of devices on the Internet. 
    <b>IPv6</b> provides more address space and improved security features, making it suitable for modern networks and the Internet of Things.
   There are different types of IP Addresses like <b>Public IP addresses</b>,<b>Private IP addresses</b>,<B>Static IP addresses</B> and <b>Dynamic IP addresses.</b>
